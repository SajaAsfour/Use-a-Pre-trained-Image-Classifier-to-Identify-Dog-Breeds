# 8.2 Image Classification for a City Dog Show 🐕🏆

## Project Overview 📝
In this project, I used Python to improve my programming skills while working with a pre-existing image classifier to identify whether an image depicts a dog 🐕 and, if so, its breed. The classifier was provided, and my focus was on applying Python skills to analyze the effectiveness of different image classification algorithms (AlexNet, VGG, and ResNet) in classifying dog breeds.

### 🎯 Project Goal
The goal of this project was to:
- Classify images as either "dogs" or "not dogs" 🐶❌.
- Identify the breed of dog in the images classified as dogs 🐕🐾.
- Determine which CNN architecture (ResNet, AlexNet, or VGG) performed the best in achieving these goals.
- Analyze the trade-off between runtime ⏱️ and accuracy for each algorithm.

### 📄 Description
The project simulates a citywide dog show 🐕🏆 where participants submit images of their dogs. The system must classify the images as "dogs" or "not dogs" and identify the breed of the dog. I used a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify images based on features learned from the ImageNet dataset.

### 🔑 Key Steps in the Project
1. **Classifying Images**: Using a pre-existing classifier function, I categorized images as "dogs" or "not dogs."
2. **Breed Classification**: For images identified as dogs, I used the CNN to predict their breed 🐕💡.
3. **Comparison of CNN Architectures**: I tested the performance of three different CNN architectures: ResNet, AlexNet, and VGG.
4. **Time Analysis**: I measured the runtime of each algorithm and evaluated the trade-off between classification accuracy and computational time ⏱️⚖️.

### 🛠️ Tools and Libraries Used
- Python 🐍
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) 🧠
- Deep Learning Libraries (e.g., PyTorch or TensorFlow, depending on the provided classifier) 🤖
- Time Module for runtime measurement ⏱️

### 🎯 Principal Objectives
1. Correctly identify "dogs" vs. "not dogs" in the provided images 🐕❌.
2. Accurately classify the breed of dogs in the images 🐕✨.
3. Compare the performance of ResNet, AlexNet, and VGG on these tasks ⚡.
4. Analyze the computational time for each algorithm ⏱️ and determine if a trade-off between accuracy and time is necessary.

### 💻 Instructions for Running the Code
1. Clone the repository to your local machine 📥.
2. Ensure you have Python and the necessary dependencies installed ⚙️.
3. Run the main program using:
   ```
   python check_images.py
   ```

### 🔮 Future Improvements
- Experiment with additional CNN architectures 🤖.
- Fine-tune the models for improved accuracy 📈.
- Optimize runtime by exploring different methods for parallel processing 🚀.
